Book Sharing app
General
Problem: I have tons of children's books, so some of them I donâ€™t read to my kids for months. So I would love to share these books with my friends, and also I would like to borrow some books for a couple of weeks to see if he likes the story and give back. But it is not easy to share the information which books I can share or borrow.

Solution: Create an app that keeps track of my books and shares a list of books I can share with my friends.

Goal:  Share the link with friends following which users can see the list of books they can borrow. Add books easily to the list by copy/pasting a link from amazon. Request selected book.
